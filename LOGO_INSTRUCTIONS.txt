    WAPOS LOGO INSTALLATION
============================================

Your logo is ready to use! Just save it to the correct location:

STEP 1: Save Your Logo Image
-----------------------------
Save your WAPOS logo file (the one you sent) as:

    C:\xampp\htdocs\wapos\assets\images\logo.png

The folder already exists, just save the file there.


STEP 2: Refresh Your Browser
-----------------------------
After saving the logo, refresh any WAPOS page and your logo will appear:
- In the sidebar navigation
- On the login page
- In PWA manifest


That's it! The system is already configured to use your logo.
============================================

Note: The logo will show in:
1. Sidebar (all pages)
2. Login page
3. Mobile app icon (when installed as PWA)
4. Browser favicon

All references are already set up in the code!
