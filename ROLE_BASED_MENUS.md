## 🔄 Dynamic Updates

The sidebar updates automatically when:
- ✅ User logs in
- ✅ User switches roles (if implemented)
- ✅ Page refreshes
- ✅ Navigation occurs

No caching issues - menus are generated server-side on every page load.

## 📝 Code Location

**File:** `includes/header.php`  
**Lines:** 93-234 (sidebar navigation)

**Key Logic:**
```php
// Get user role
$userRole = $auth->getUser()['role'] ?? 'guest';

// Conditional menu display
if (in_array($userRole, ['admin', 'manager', 'cashier'])) {
    // Show menu items
}
```
